## About Me
I am from Santa Fe, New Mexico, born and raised. 
I am a consultant at Plante Moran specializing in backend ETL development and building small to medium-scale data warehouses.
I primarily coded in Python and SQL. However, I am always looking for opportunities to learn new programs and expand on my technical skills.

Here I worked with a team, where we created multiple models that would help predict the outcome of an NBA game using a variety of variables. The models were then compared to one another to determine which one was the most accurate and had the best fit.
