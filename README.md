## About Me
I'm from Santa Fe, New Mexico, born and raised. 
I currently do consulting, specializing in backend ETL development and building small to medium-scale data warehouses.
I primarily code in Python and SQL, but I'm always looking for opportunities to learn new programs and expand my technical skills. 
Apart from programming, I enjoy playing soccer, running, snowboarding, and watching films! 

In this repository, you'll find a few personal projects I have worked on. Check them out!
